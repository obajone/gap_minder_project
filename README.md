# Gapminder World Data Exploration
## by Eddington Obaro Jonathan

## Dataset

> This report analyses the [gapminder world dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). This includes three datasets which are the [child_mortality_0_5_year_olds_dying_per_1000_born dataset](http://www.gapm.io/du5mr/), the [life_expectancy_years dataset](http://gapm.io/ilex), and the [income_per_person_gdppercapita_ppp_inflation_adjusted dataset](http://gapm.io/dgdppc).
>
>The datasets are based on three different indicators which are child mortality rate under age five (which describes Child mortality under age 5, for all countries for all years between 1800 to 2100), Life Expectancy at Birth and GDP per capita in constant PPP dollars. After the data wrangling, the dataset structure contains 45599 rows and 5 columns.

## Research Questions
Three indicators were used to investigate:
- whether certain regions of the world have been growing better than others;
- there are trends that can be observed between the indicators.


## Summary of Findings

This analysis found out that:
- Certain regions of the world have been growing better than others.
- As child mortality decreases, life expectancy increases.
- As income increases, child mortality decreases.
- As income increases, life expectancy also increases.
